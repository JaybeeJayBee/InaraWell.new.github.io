            <h2 class="section-title">Why Trust InaraWell?</h2>
            <p class="intro">At InaraWell, our journey began with a simple, profound belief: that personal growth shouldn't be complicated or overwhelming. We saw a gap in the self-help world – a flood of complex theories and demanding routines that felt out of reach for people navigating busy lives. We created InaraWell to bridge that gap, offering genuinely usable tools that support you, rather than add to your stress. Our mission is to make self-improvement accessible, effective, and truly integrated into your daily rhythm, one thoughtful step at a time.</p>

                    <h3>Mindful Design</h3>
                    <p>Every tool we create, from our journals to our clarity guides, is crafted with simplicity and effectiveness at its core. We believe that true self-help should fit seamlessly into your day, not become another item on an already long to-do list. Our minimalist approach ensures that you can focus on what truly matters: your growth.</p>

                    <h3>Science-Backed Approach</h3>

This commitment means you're using methods that are evidence-based, providing you with practical strategies that truly work for sustainable personal development.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Every InaraWell tool, from our self-help journals to our mental clarity systems, undergoes a rigorous development process to ensure it delivers genuine value and impactful results.</p>
            <ul id="process-list" style="counter-reset: step-counter;">
                <li>
                    <h3>Concept Development</h3>
                    <p>We begin by brainstorming ideas for new tools, deeply considering the evolving needs of individuals seeking growth, current wellness insights, and the most effective psychological principles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Foundational Research</h3>
                    <p>Instead of ingredients, we meticulously research and gather foundational principles, scientific data, and proven psychological frameworks. This ensures our creations are not only effective but also responsibly informed and built on solid ground.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tool Development & Refinement</h3>
                    <p>We then move into the actual creation and rigorous testing of our tools. Each journal, exercise, or system is carefully refined to ensure it is practical, easy to integrate into daily life, and designed to consistently deliver the positive impact you seek.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Internal Review & User Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Before any tool reaches you, it undergoes thorough internal reviews by our team. We also gather invaluable feedback from pilot users to ensure every creation meets our exceptionally high standards for clarity, efficacy, and an optimal user experience.</p>
